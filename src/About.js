      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m Arshiya, a second-year B.Tech student studying Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. 
        I’m really interested in technology, especially how AI can make a difference in the world. Along with my studies,
         I also enjoy writing and designing. I like to explore new ideas and put them into creative projects. 
         I’m excited to keep learning and grow in both tech and creative fields</p>
